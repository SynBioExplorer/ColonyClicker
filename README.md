# ColonyClicker

ColonyClicker is an innovative tool designed for microbiologists, bioengineers, and anyone working with petri dish cultures. It simplifies the process of counting colony-forming units (CFUs) by allowing users to upload images of their petri dishes and manually annotate each colony. This intuitive interface not only speeds up the counting process but also improves accuracy by minimizing human error.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of petri dishes for analysis.
- **Manual Annotation**: Click on each colony to annotate and count, with each click incrementing the total count displayed.
- **Real-Time Count Display**: The total count of annotated colonies is displayed in real-time, ensuring accuracy.
- **Save and Download**: Annotated images, complete with colony counts, can be saved and downloaded for record-keeping or further analysis.
